# DATABASE

## Introduction ✨

A database using blockchain technology operates as a decentralized and distributed ledger, where data is securely stored across a network of interconnected nodes. Unlike traditional databases centralized in a single location, blockchain databases are distributed, meaning each participant in the network holds a copy of the database.

## Technologies Used 🧑‍💻
