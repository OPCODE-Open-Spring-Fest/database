# About The Project

A database using blockchain technology operates as a decentralized and distributed ledger, where data is securely stored across a network of interconnected nodes. Unlike traditional databases centralized in a single location, blockchain databases are distributed, meaning each participant in the network holds a copy of the database. This redundancy ensures high resilience against data loss or corruption.

Blockchain databases utilize cryptographic techniques to secure data integrity and prevent unauthorized tampering. Each block in the chain contains a set of transactions, cryptographically linked to the preceding block, forming an immutable record of all transactions. Once added to the chain, data cannot be altered retroactively without consensus from the majority of network participants, making blockchain databases highly resistant to fraud and manipulation.

Smart contracts, self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code, can be integrated into blockchain databases. These contracts automate and enforce predefined rules and conditions, facilitating trustless transactions and reducing the need for intermediaries.

Blockchain databases find applications across various industries, including finance, supply chain management, healthcare, and identity verification. They offer increased transparency, efficiency, and security, revolutionizing traditional database systems by providing a decentralized, tamper-proof, and trustless infrastructure for storing and managing data.
